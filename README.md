## About this project
Obesity is a significant global health issue and a major risk factor for numerous chronic diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. Accurate prediction and early identification of individuals at risk are crucial for developing effective intervention and prevention strategies. This project leverages machine learning (ML) techniques to classify obesity risk levels using a comprehensive dataset of demographic, health, and lifestyle variables sourced from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

## Methodology
For this analysis, three machine learning models were employed to classify individuals' obesity risk based on NHANES data. These models include Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest. The selection allows for a comparison between a straightforward baseline model and a powerful, non-linear classifier to determine the most effective approach for this prediction task. All the coding are deployed in python environment with necessary packages like: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn.
